## Goal:

Build a tool to explore GOES-16 satellite imagery of hurricanes in the Atlantic.

## Data Profile:

The dataset consists of about 100,000+ mesoscale satellite images in netCDF format of hurricanes from 2018-2021. These are currently organized into a mongodb database on my local machine.

## Done So Far:

* used tools from goes2go to create plots of plots of 5 major hurricanes that hightlight different satellite bands, and well as true color images.
* used Satpy to generate animations of storms at their peak strength
* created plots of storm strength over the life of the storm, and as well as storm location

## Next Steps: 

After today's intro, I am working on setting up a streamlit dashboard to browse these plots. I also want to use the AWS-hosted netCDF files directly rather than downloading them to my local machine.
